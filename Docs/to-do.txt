1. i am going to introduce multiple roles based access, for example, admin who is a developer, admin who is just menu setter and stuff, so make changes accordingly such that we are always checkign roles from an Array, and for now i want you to add another role called developer..in the schema let us change it entirely, no need of an admin_users table, instead we will have a roles table and then a roles field in the customer table so that roles field is an array that contains all the roles of that user, so if admin is 1 and developer is 2, then the user will have roles field [1,2]....and similarly lets add a Roles page to the side bar which allows us to manage these roles. similartly in login and stuff, or ANYWHERE in the codebase where we were checking and depending on admin_users table, let us start using this...and also i want you to handle everywhere that we check for admin or any role, right now we are using local storage, so we will continue doing that, make sure you check all places
